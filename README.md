The API should reply to the resource request /Listings that takes the number of passengers as a
parameter.
The code should call the search endpoint
https://jayridechallengeapi.azurewebsites.net/api/QuoteRequest to get the search data. Utilising the
listings array, filter out listings that donâ€™t support the number of passengers. With the remaining listings,
calculate the total price and return the results sorted by total price
